# Modular Ontology Engineering with CoModIDE

CoModIDE is a plugin for Protégé that enables graphical drag-and-drop editing of ontologies, with built in support for Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs). CoModIDE allows for simple construction and maintenance of modular ontologies; moreover, by taking an opinionated position on how to render OWL axioms on a graphical canvas, and which axioms to generate from constructs on said canvas, CoModIDE represents an attempt to develop the fine-grained method guidance we believe is missing from ODP usage methodologies.

This tutorial aims to illustrate to participants how to use CoModIDE for both applied ontology engineering, and research on ontology engineering methodology. Specifically, our objectives are:

1. To teach the participants how to use the CoModIDE tool for the construction and maintenance of small- to medium-sized modular ontologies based on design patterns.
2. To illustrate the utility of modular ontology engineering to researchers, such that they can use and spread these methods and tools in projects with industry.

## Learning Objectives

After taking this tutorial, participants should:

1. Be able to select, instantiate, align, and remove ontology design pattern-based modules into/from a modular ontology using CoModIDE.
2. Be able to apply the XD methodology and CoModIDE to create and evolve medium-sized ontologies.
3. Understand the design choices that have gone into the CoModIDE tooling, including the tradeoffs between usability and logic expressivity that need to be considered when rendering ontologies graphically.

## Presenters

**Karl Hammar**  
Jönköping AI Lab, Jönköping University, Sweden  
Email: [karl.hammar@jail.ai](mailto:karl.hammar@jail.ai)

Karl holds a PhD from Linköping University, Sweden, and is employed within the Jönköping Artificial Intelligence Lab (JAIL) at Jönköping University, Sweden. Karl’s PhD dissertation focused specifically on ontology engineering methods and tools supporting the use of Ontology Design Patterns. His research since has continued in this direction, focusing on applied ontology engineering in real-world scenarios, ranging from building automation and analytics, to veterinary syndromic surveillance.

**Cogan Shimizu**  
Data Semantics Lab, Kansas State University, USA

Cogan is a PhD candidate at Kansas State University (KSU), USA and is a member of the Data Semantics Laboratory, also at KSU. Cogan’s dissertation work focuses on ontology engineering methodologies, specifically those that involve ontology design patterns, with an intended result of making ontology engineering more accessible to non-ontologists. Currently, his work involves the development, use, and evaluation of intuitive tooling infrastructure to support such methodologies.
